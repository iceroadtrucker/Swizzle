[Go to Swizzle repository](https://github.com/swizzle-app/swizzle.git)

Have a look on the organisation "Swizzle". Swizzle was founded as four-week final project as journeyman’s piece of my Neue Fische Data Science Bootcamp. As a group of 4, we developed it to our final presentation in January. Actually this project is still continued privately.
